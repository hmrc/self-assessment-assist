The HMRC Assist report is generated using the customersâ€™ National Insurance number (NINO) and Calculation ID. The report contains targeted messages contained within the JSON response for the customer.

This API allows developers to:

* retrieve a HMRC Assist report for a given customer with a list of messages for the customer
* securely generate a report that is sent to or displayed after it has been generated
* allow the client to acknowledge the report
