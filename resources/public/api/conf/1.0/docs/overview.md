The HMRC Assist report is based on the customers’ National Insurance number (nino) and Calculation ID. The report contains a list of ‘Errors’, ‘Warnings’, and ‘Info’ for the given National Insurance number (nino) and Calculation ID.

This API allows developers to:

* retrieve a HMRC Assist report for a given customer with a list of warnings and possible errors
* securely generate a report that is sent to or displayed after it has been generated
* allow the client to acknowledge the report
