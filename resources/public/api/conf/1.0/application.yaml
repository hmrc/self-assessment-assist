    # Overview
    The HMRC Assist report is generated using the customersâ€™ National Insurance number (NINO) and Calculation ID. The report contains targeted messages contained within the JSON response for the customer.
    
    This API allows developers to: 
    
    * retrieve a HMRC Assist report for a given customer with a list of messages for the customer
    * securely generate a report that is sent to or displayed after it has been generated
    * allow the client to acknowledge the report

    # Versioning
    When an API changes in a way that is backwards-incompatible, we increase the version number of the API. 
    See our [reference guide](/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#versioning) for more on
    versioning.
    # Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:
    - 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    - 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    - 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server
    
    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our 
    [reference guide](/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#errors) for more on errors.

    # Testing
    You can use the sandbox environment to <a href="/api-documentation/docs/testing">test this API</a>. You can use the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-platform-test-user/1.0">Create Test User API</a> or it's frontend service to create test users.
    It may not be possible to test all scenarios in the sandbox. You can test some scenarios by passing the `Gov-Test-Scenario` header. Documentation for each endpoint includes a **Test data** section, which explains the scenarios that you can simulate using the `Gov-Test-Scenario` header.
    If you have a specific testing need that is not supported in the sandbox, contact <a href="/developer/support">our support team</a>.
    Some APIs may be marked \[test only\]. This means that they are not available for use in production and may change.
