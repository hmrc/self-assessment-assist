    # Overview
    The HMRC Assist report is generated using the customers’ National Insurance number (NINO), Calculation ID and Tax year. The report contains targeted messages contained within the JSON response for the customer.§

    This API allows developers to:

    * retrieve a HMRC Assist report for a given customer with a list of messages for the customer
    * securely generate a report that is sent to or displayed after it has been generated
    * allow the client to acknowledge the report
    # Send Fraud Prevention Data

    [Check the data you need to send](/guides/fraud-prevention/). You can also use the [Test API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/txm-fph-validator-api/1.0) during initial development and as part of your quality assurance checks.

    # Versioning
    When an API changes in a way that is backwards-incompatible, we increase the version number of the API.
    See our [reference guide](/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#versioning) for more on
    versioning.
    # Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:
    - 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    - 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    - 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our
    [reference guide](/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#errors) for more on errors.

    # Testing
    You can use the sandbox environment to <a href="/api-documentation/docs/testing">test this API</a>. You can use the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-platform-test-user/1.0">Create Test User API</a> or it's frontend service to create test users.
    It may not be possible to test all scenarios in the sandbox. You can test some scenarios by passing the `Gov-Test-Scenario` header. Documentation for each endpoint includes a **Test data** section, which explains the scenarios that you can simulate using the `Gov-Test-Scenario` header.
    If you have a specific testing need that is not supported in the sandbox, contact <a href="/developer/support">our support team</a>.
    Some APIs may be marked \[test only\]. This means that they are not available for use in production and may change.
